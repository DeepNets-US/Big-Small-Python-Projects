# ðŸ¥• Carrot in a Box Game ðŸ“¦

The "Carrot in a Box" game is a Python script that simulates a fun game between two players involving mystery boxes containing either a carrot or no carrot. This README file aims to explain the game's mechanics without delving into the actual code.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play
1. **Setting Up:** 
   - Two players participate in the game.
   - Each player gets a mystery box. One box contains a red color and the other a gold color.
   
2. **Game Flow:**
   - **Initial Display:** The game starts by displaying two boxes, one with a red lid and the other with a gold lid, each assigned to a player.
   
   - **Revealing the Contents:** Player 1 opens their box. If a carrot is found inside, a special display showing the carrot along with the box contents is presented.
   
   - **Decision-making:** Player 1 announces if there is a carrot in their box or not without revealing the actual content.
   
   - **Box Swap Decision:** Player 2 is then given the option to swap the boxes or keep them as they are.
   
   - **Final Reveal:** Depending on the decision (to swap or not), the script reveals the contents of the boxes and declares the player who has the carrot.

## ðŸŽ¯ Gameplay Strategy
- Player 1 opens their box to find out if it contains a carrot or not.
- Player 2 must decide whether to swap boxes based on the announcement made by Player 1.
- The decision to swap or not is critical since the player with the carrot wins!

## ðŸ¤” Understanding the Outcome
- If Player 1 found the carrot and Player 2 decides to swap, the script reveals who gets the carrot after the swap.
- If Player 1 found the carrot and Player 2 decides not to swap, Player 1 keeps the carrot.
- If Player 1 did not find the carrot and Player 2 decides to swap, Player 2 gets the carrot after the swap.
- If Player 1 did not find the carrot and Player 2 decides not to swap, Player 2 doesnâ€™t get the carrot.

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Code
- Ensure you have Python installed.
- Copy the provided Python code into a Python editor or file.
- Run the code to start the game and follow the instructions provided.

**Note:** This README serves as an explanatory guide. For code details and implementation, refer to the Python script directly.
