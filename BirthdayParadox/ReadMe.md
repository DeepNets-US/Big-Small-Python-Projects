# Birthday Paradox Simulation 🎉🎂

Welcome to the Birthday Paradox simulation, where we explore the fascinating world of probability and shared birthdays! 📅🤯

## Overview:

The Birthday Paradox is a captivating probability puzzle that reveals the surprising likelihood of at least two people sharing the same birthday as you add more individuals to a group. With just 23 people, there's approximately a 50% chance of a shared birthday, and with 50 people, it's about 97%. This paradox challenges our intuition about probability and has practical applications in various fields.

## How to Run the Simulation:

1. **User Input:**
   - Enter the number of birthdays to generate (Max 100).

2. **Generate Birthdays:**
   - The program generates random birthdays and displays them.

3. **Find a Match:**
   - Determine if there's a matching birthday within the generated set.

4. **Run 100,000 Simulations:**
   - Explore the probability of matching birthdays in groups of various sizes.

5. **Visualize the Results:**
   - View a probability graph after each set of simulations and a final bar graph for the overall probability.

## Key Components:

- **BirthdayParadox Class:**
  - Handles the simulation, birthday generation, and matching logic.

- **Simulation Script (run.py):**
  - Takes user input, generates birthdays, runs simulations, and visualizes results.

## Run the Simulation:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/big-small-python-projects.git
   ```

2. Run the simulation:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```
