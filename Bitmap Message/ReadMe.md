# üåç Bitmap Message Generator üé®

Welcome to the Bitmap Message Generator! This Python script lets you display your own messages on a customizable world bitmap. It's a fun way to visualize your messages in a unique and global context!

## What is a Bitmap?
In computing, a bitmap is a graphical representation of a spatially-mapped collection of pixels. In simpler terms, it's a grid of characters forming an image. In this project, our bitmap represents a stylized world.

## How does it work?
The Bitmap Message Generator takes a message of your choice and overlays it on the world bitmap. You can easily customize the message or even create your own bitmap file for a completely unique display.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/DeepNets-US/Big-Small-Python-Projects/tree/main/Bitmap%20Message
   ```

2. **Run the Script:**
   ```
   python bitmap_generator.py
   ```

3. **Enter your Message:**
   - Press Enter to use the default message, or type your own.

4. **Choose Bitmap File:**
   - Press Enter to use the default world bitmap or enter the path to your custom bitmap file.

5. **Enjoy the Visual Display:**
   - Your message will be displayed on the world bitmap in a creative and interactive way!

## Customization
You can easily change the appearance by modifying the world bitmap text file. Feel free to create your own bitmap file and pass its path when prompted. Experiment with different messages and bitmaps to create visually stunning displays!
