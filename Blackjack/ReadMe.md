Blackjack, also known as 21, is a popular card game played in casinos around the world. The game is straightforward and involves comparing card values between the player and the dealer. The primary objective is to have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without exceeding 21.

Here are the basic rules of Blackjack:

1. **Card Values:**
   - Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
   - Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are each worth 10 points.
   - Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the hand more.

2. **The Setup:**
   - The game is typically played with one or more decks of standard playing cards.
   - Each player, including the dealer, is dealt two cards. Players' cards are usually dealt face up, while the dealer has one card face up (known as the "upcard") and one card face down (the "hole card").

3. **Gameplay:**
   - Players take turns deciding whether to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).
   - The goal is to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without going over ("busting").
   - Players can continue to take additional cards (hit) until they decide to stand or until their hand exceeds 21, resulting in a bust.

4. **Dealer's Turn:**
   - Once all players have completed their turn, the dealer reveals their hole card.
   - The dealer must follow a specific set of rules, usually hitting until they reach at least 17.
   - If the dealer busts, all remaining players win.

5. **Winning:**
   - If a player's hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand, without busting, the player wins.
   - If the player's hand equals the dealer's hand, it's a push (a tie), and the player's bet is returned.
   - If the player busts, they lose their bet regardless of the dealer's hand.

6. **Blackjack:**
   - A "Blackjack" is a special hand consisting of an Ace and a 10-value card (10, Jack, Queen, or King) and is the highest possible hand.
   - A player with a Blackjack usually receives a higher payout, often 3:2.

7. **Doubling Down:**
   - Players may also have the option to "double down," doubling their initial bet in exchange for committing to stand after receiving one more card.

These are the basic rules of Blackjack. Keep in mind that specific casino rules can vary, so it's always a good idea to familiarize yourself with the rules of the particular game you are playing.
